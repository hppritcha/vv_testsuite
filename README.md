# OpenSHMEM Validation and Verification Test Suite

This is a sandbox for development of a Verfication and Validation test suite for us
by the OpenSHMEM community.  The objectives of this effort are to have an implementation agnostic
test suite which can be used for

* compliance validation of an OpenSHMEM implementation,
* continuous integration testing,
* performance regression testing.
